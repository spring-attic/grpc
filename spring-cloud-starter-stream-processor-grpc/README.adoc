= gRPC Processor

This processor uses gRPC to process Messages via a remote process written in any language that supports gRPC. This
pattern, commonly referred to as `sidecar` is intended to allow the Java app to handle the stream processing while
the Polyglot sidecar application handles the business logic. The sidecar application must implement a
link:https://grpc.io/[grpc] service using link:../grpc-app-protos/src/main/proto/processor.proto[this Google protocol
buffers schema].

[NOTE]
====
The gRPC client stub is blocking by default. An asynchronous stub is provided as an option. This might perform
better under certain circumstances (e.g., if the server is multi-threaded) however message ordering will not be
guaranteed.
====

== Input

=== Headers
Headers are available to the sidecar application via the link:../grpc-app-protos/src/main/proto/message.proto[message]
schema if `grpc.include-headers` is `true`. Most common types are supported, however specific mapping of numeric types
between Java and other languages
varies among languages (for example some languages do not distinguish between long and short integers).

=== Payload
It is expected that the payload will normally be a string or byte array. However common primitive types are supported
 as defined by the link:../grpc-app-protos/src/main/proto/message.proto[schema].

== Output

=== Headers
In most cases the return message should simply contain the original headers provided.
The sidecar application may modify or add headers however it is recommended to only add headers if necessary.

=== Payload
It is expected that the payload will normally be a string or byte array. However common primitive types are supported
 as defined by the link:../grpc-app-protos/src/main/proto/message.proto[schema].
